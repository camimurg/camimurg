Hi everyone, I am a Junior Fullstack Developer, freelancing atm but looking for new job opporunities.

I’m currently working on a RoR mobile application (BE&FE) and other small projects oriented more in FE to improve my portfolio.

I'm also learning more about JavaScript and always training with Ruby!
