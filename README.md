### Camimurg 🌙 

Hi everyone, I am a Junior Fullstack Developer, freelancing atm but looking for new job opporunities.

I’m currently working on a RoR mobile application (BE&FE) for Pretty Deadly Self Defence (https://prettydeadlyselfdefense.com/) and other small projects oriented more in FE to improve my portfolio.

I'm learning more about JavaScript and always training with Ruby!

You can reach me out here: camimurg@gmail.com
